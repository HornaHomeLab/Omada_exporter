# Omada_exporter
##### version: 0.0.2

Prometheus Exporter for [TP-Link Omada](https://www.tp-link.com/en/business-networking/omada/controller/) SDN.

Due to current limitations of Omada OpenAPI, both Web API and OpenAPI are supported.

## How to run
Create the `.env` file to provide necessary values specified in [Parameters](#parameters) section.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> `.env` file filled with data from table should be saved in `./app` directory before building docker image.

### Parameters
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
|`BASE_URL`|The URL to Omada portal, including protocol and port. Both http and https are supported|
|`VERIFY_CERTIFICATE`|Mostly related to HTTPS if you are using untrusted certificate|
|`SITE_NAME`|Name of the site to monitor| 
|`OMADA_CLIENT_ID`|Client ID for app created in section Platform Integration, used for OpenAPI requests|
|`OMADA_CLIENT_SECRET`|Client Secret for app created in section Platform Integration, used for OpenAPI requests|
|`OMADA_USER`|User name of the account which will be used to authenticate to the WebAPI|
|`OMADA_USER_PASSWORD`|Password for the account which will be used to authenticate to the WebAPI|

### Omada Auth objects permissions
- **OpenAPI Application** (*OMADA_CLIENT*) - It can be created at the Global management level of the controller in path: 
`Setttings -> Platform Integration`. 
OpenApi app needs administrator role assigned, 
to be able to query all endpoints used within this exporter
- **User Account** (*OMADA_USER*) - it is a standard user account ,
which can be created at Global management level of the controller,
in path: `Account`. `viewer` role will provide enough access for 
this "service" user account.
